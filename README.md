## What is CBT?

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely-used and highly effective form of therapy designed to help people identify, challenge, and replace unhelpful thoughts and behaviors. Developed by psychiatrist Dr. Aaron Beck in the 1960s, CBT was initially created to treat depression but has since proven effective for a variety of mental health issues, including anxiety, stress, PTSD, and even everyday challenges like procrastination and self-doubt. CBT’s core idea is simple but powerful: by learning to spot unhelpful thought patterns and replace them with healthier perspectives, we can improve our emotional well-being and make positive behavioral changes.

CBT has become one of the most researched and trusted approaches in mental health and is often called the “gold standard” of therapy for its practical, hands-on approach.
